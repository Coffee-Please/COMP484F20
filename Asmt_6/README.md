**Text Limiter**

In this lab, you will be creating a HTML5 web form. By the time you are reading this manual, you already know HTML and CSS and JavaScript. 
The forms are based upon the one you built in class. Change some existing HTML elements add new stuff to make your page look like the one 
show in the examples. Again, try to follow CSUN Identity Guideline for your CSS. At least, you need to maintain a consistent styling for 
both parts of this lab.

You will use this webpage to show your skill of handling string character in JavaScript.

You are asked to develop a web tool to allow webmasters and content publishers to strategically construct meta description tags of a page 
that will result in aesthetically-pleasing or eye-catching listings in online search results. For example, Google shows up to 156 characters 
(including spaces) of a page's meta description tag. If a page's meta description tag exceeds 156 characters, Google will show as many whole 
words as it can, and the rest are replaced with an ellipsis (...).

![Example of a Google Search result]()

The URL of the page is

https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2009/04/gold-hunters-dig-for-lost-underground-empire-of-the-lizard-people.html 

In your code,

- Declare a variable named “lastSpace”, "limitedText" and “originalText”;
- Use the lastIndexOf() method to find the last space before 153 characters;
- Use the slice() method to trim the text from the first character to the lastSpace position you just found and show the number of remaining characters in “Character Count”;
- Test your code by click the “submit” button and make sure that if you enter a chunk of text that includes spaces it will be trimmed to the 
first space encountered before 153th characters and replace the rest contents with an ellipsis (...). Your form should behave similar to the one shown below:

Original text:
 
The Times reported that Rex. I. McCreery and Ray Martin provided an ancient parchment map showing the Lizard People's underground empire, 
which allegedly stretched from the Central Library on 5th Street to the Southwest Museum, which you must admit is a lot of digging. Earlier 
Times clips report that Shufelt had been a mining engineer employed by a mine in Kingman, Ariz., so evidently he was legitimate. Unfortunately, 
The Times' stories about the gold excavation are vague and conflicting about the origin of the map. Most stories say it belonged to McCreery and 
Martin, who presumably brought in Shufelt as a partner because he was a mining engineer. Our later story says Shufelt got the map from "Little 
Chief Greenleaf" alias L. Macklin.  March 3, 1933: Gold hunters are excavating directly over the Broadway tunnel, a long-gone downtown landmark 
that was just north of the Hall of Justice.  Evidently they didn't question why the crews digging the tunnel didn't find anything.

You will be graded according to each items in both parts. Be sure you have met all of the criteria. You will use JSBin to submit your assignment.  Once you have modified your form as directed above, lock a copy of it by using the Share menu in JSBin. This will provide a locked URL that represents your work.  Submit this URL for grading.

Good luck and have fun!
